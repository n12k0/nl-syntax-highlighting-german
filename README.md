# Natural Language Syntax Highlighting

**This is a fork of the original Natural Language Syntax Highlighting plugin, adapted to work with German text as well as English.**

This version uses the [de-compromise](https://github.com/nlp-compromise/de-compromise) library for German language support, instead of the original [compromise](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) library for English.

A plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) that highlights adjectives, nouns, adverbs, verbs, articles, and conjunctions in the editor. Inspired by iA Writer.

Colours can be customised in the plugin settings.
